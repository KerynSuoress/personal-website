<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<h2>Here are some of the things I like to do in my spare time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shows and movies</h3>
<p>After a long day's work or at some point during the weekend I sometimes like to become a couch potato along with my girlfriend. Recently we watched the movie "Old" by Shamalan and we are currently watching "After Life" by Ricky Gervais.</p>

<h3>Motorcycle related</h3>
<p>One of the activities I like the most is going for a ride on my Kawasaki Versys. I love touring the lanscapes of my beautiful country with my girlfriend, or going out with the boys on our motorcycles at night. I also love cars and anything with an engine in it, really.</p>

<h3>Videogames</h3>
<p>Although I don't have as much time as I would like (you know, being an adult and all that boring stuff), I try to make the time to enjoy some pc gaming. I mostly like difficult, action packed, story rich games. Recently I got to level 100 in Diablo IV and currently I am playing Lies of P.</p>

<h3>Learning new skills</h3>
<p>I have the goal to learn at least 3 new skills every year. For 2024 the plan is to learn web development, achieve proficiency Italian, and learn some guitar.</p>
